small game engine based on [The Cherno's Game Engine Series](https://youtu.be/JxIZbV_XjAs). the main goal is to make an engine I can use for my silly game ideas while also serving as a source of learning and playground for software design.

planned features:

- [ ] world editor (eclipse)
- [ ] actor component system
- [ ] lua scripting
- [ ] 2d physics
- [ ] 3d models maybe

build steps:

`cmake -Bbuild && cmake --build build`
